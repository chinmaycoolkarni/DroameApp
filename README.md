Summary:
•	My application comprises of five modules as follows:
1.	Authentication Module
2.	Customer CRUD
3.	Location CRUD
4.	Drone Shot CRUD
5.	Bookings CRUD

•	Authentication Module:
This module deals with the registration and authentication of the operator, though initially after an attribute is maintained to allow access or not. We can use this attribute in case we wish to restrict the operators who are not given the access in future scopes.

•	Customer CRUD:
Customer CRUD helps us to create, read, update and delete the customer record.

•	Location CRUD:
Location CRUD helps us to create, read, update and delete the location record.

•	Drone Shot CRUD:
Drone Shot CRUD helps us to create, read, update and delete the drone shot record.

•	Booking CRUD:
Booking CRUD helps us to create, read, update and delete the booking record. Here in the booking contains the above three models’ objects using an attribute customer_id, location_id, drone_shot_id in the database table.

Thank you!
